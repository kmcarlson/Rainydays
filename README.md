A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

In this assignment, you’ll be using the WordPress REST API to manage the products for your website deployed on Netlify. Instead of having the products hardcoded into the HTML, you will use JavaScript to fetch the list of WordPress products and display them on your site. It’s essential to note the two different aspects of the assignment: the WordPress REST API running on your web host, and your JavaScript in the cross-course project, making a call to that API. WordPress will generate a front-end, but that’s not what we’re using it for in this assignment; we’re using it as a Headless CMS
